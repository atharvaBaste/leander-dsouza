I am Leander Stephen D'Souza, and people call me ðŸŒˆ LSD! ðŸŒˆ, just for not the reasons you think. It's just because my name acronym spells out a psychedelic drug.


That being said, I'm a robotics and tech enthusiast. I love working on projects that inspire me and motivate me in developing innovative/disruptive solutions.
I'm proficient in Image Processing and ROS ðŸ¤–. My dream is to contribute in the fields of mobile robotics.


As of now, I'm pursuing a B.Tech Degree in Mechatronics from [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://manipal.edu/mit.html). I will have graduated in the year 2022.
